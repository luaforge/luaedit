							Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
							of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
							</PRE>						
							
							
							<H2>Preamble</H2>
							
							<P>
							  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
							freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
							License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
							software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
							General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
							Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
							using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
							the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
							your programs, too.
							
							</P>
							<P>
							  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
							price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
							have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
							this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
							if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
							in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
							
							</P>
							<P>
							  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
							anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
							These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
							distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
							
							</P>
							<P>
							  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
							gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
							you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
							source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
							rights.
							
							</P>
							<P>
							  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
							(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
							distribute and/or modify the software.
							
							</P>
							<P>
							  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
							that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
							software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
							want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
							that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
							authors' reputations.
							
							</P>
							<P>
							  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
							patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
							program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
							program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
							patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
							
							</P>
							<P>
							  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
							modification follow.
							
							</P>
							
							
							<H2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</H2>
							
							
							<P>
							
							<STRONG>0.</STRONG>
							 This License applies to any program or other work which contains
							a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
							under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
							refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
							means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
							that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
							either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
							language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
							the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
							<P>
							
							Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
							covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
							running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
							is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
							Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
							Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
							
							<P>
							
							<STRONG>1.</STRONG>
							 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
							source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
							conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
							copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
							notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
							and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
							along with the Program.
							<P>
							
							You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
							you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
							<P>
							
							<STRONG>2.</STRONG>
							 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
							of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
							distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
							above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
							<P>
							
							<DL>
							<DT>
							<DD>
							<STRONG>a)</STRONG>
							     You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
							     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
							</DD>
							</DT>
							</DL>
							<P>
							<DL>
							<DT>
							<DD>
							<STRONG>b)</STRONG>
							     You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
							     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
							     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
							     parties under the terms of this License.
							</DD>
							</DT>
							</DL>
							<P>
							<DL>
							<DT>
							<DD>
							<STRONG>c)</STRONG>
							     If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
							     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
							     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
							     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
							     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
							     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
							     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
							     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
							     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
							     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
							</DD>
							</DT>
							</DL>
							<P>
							
							These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
							identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
							and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
							themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
							sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
							distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
							on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
							this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
							entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
							<P>
							
							Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
							your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
							exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
							collective works based on the Program.
							<P>
							
							In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
							with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
							a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
							the scope of this License.
							
							<P>
							
							<STRONG>3.</STRONG>
							 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
							under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
							Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
							
							
							<!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
							<!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->
							
							<DL>
							<DT>
							<DD>
							<STRONG>a)</STRONG>
							     Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
							     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
							     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
							</DD>
							</DT>
							</DL>
							<P>
							<DL>
							<DT>
							<DD>
							<STRONG>b)</STRONG>
							     Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
							     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
							     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
							     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
							     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
							     customarily used for software interchange; or,
							</DD>
							</DT>
							</DL>
							<P>
							<DL>
							<DT>
							<DD>
							<STRONG>c)</STRONG>
							     Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
							     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
							     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
							     received the program in object code or executable form with such
							     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
							</DD>
							</DT>
							</DL>
							<P>
							
							The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
							making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
							code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
							associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
							control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
							special exception, the source code distributed need not include
							anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
							form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
							operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
							itself accompanies the executable.
							<P>
							
							If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
							access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
							access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
							distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
							compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
							<P>
							
							<STRONG>4.</STRONG>
							 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
							except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
							otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
							void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
							However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
							this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
							parties remain in full compliance.
							
							<P>
							
							<STRONG>5.</STRONG>
							 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
							signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
							distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
							prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
							modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
							Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
							all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
							the Program or works based on it.
							
							<P>
							
							<STRONG>6.</STRONG>
							 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
							Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
							original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
							these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
							restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
							You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
							this License.
							
							<P>
							
							<STRONG>7.</STRONG>
							 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
							infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
							conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
							otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
							excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
							distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
							License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
							may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
							license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
							all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
							the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
							refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
							<P>
							
							If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
							any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
							apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
							circumstances.
							<P>
							
							It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
							patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
							such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
							integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
							implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
							generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
							through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
							system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
							to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
							impose that choice.
							<P>
							
							This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
							be a consequence of the rest of this License.
							
							<P>
							
							<STRONG>8.</STRONG>
							 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
							certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
							original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
							may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
							those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
							countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
							the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
							
							<P>
							
							<STRONG>9.</STRONG>
							 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
							of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
							be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
							address new problems or concerns.
							<P>
							
							Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
							specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
							later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
							either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
							Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
							this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
							Foundation.
							
							<P>
							
							
							<STRONG>10.</STRONG>
							 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
							programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
							to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
							Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
							make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
							of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
							of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
							
							
							
							<P><STRONG>NO WARRANTY</STRONG></P>
							
							<P>
							
							<STRONG>11.</STRONG>
							 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
							FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
							OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
							PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
							OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
							MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
							TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
							PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
							REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
							
							<P>
							
							<STRONG>12.</STRONG>
							 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
							WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
							REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
							INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
							OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
							TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
							YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
							PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
							POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

							  available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
							  Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring
							  that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
							  Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
							 <h3 id="section-3.3">3.3. Description of Modifications.</h3>
							 <p>You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the
							  changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a
							  prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
							  Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in
							  (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation
							  in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
							 <h3 id="section-3.4">3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</h3>
							 <h4 id="section-3.4-a">(a) Third Party Claims</h4>
							 <p>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property
							  rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections
							  <a href="#section-2.1">2.1</a> or <a href="#section-2.2">2.2</a>, Contributor must include a
							  text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
							  party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
							  Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
							  Section <a href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in
							  all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as
							  notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
							  received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
							 <h4 id="section-3.4-b">(b) Contributor APIs</h4>
							 <p>If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor
							  has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that
							  <abbr>API</abbr>, Contributor must also include this information in the
							  <strong class="very-strong">legal</strong> file.
							 <h4 id="section-3.4-c">(c) Representations.</h4>
							 <p>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4
							  (<a href="#section-3.4-a">a</a>) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications
							  are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the
							  rights conveyed by this License.
							 <h3 id="section-3.5">3.5. Required Notices.</h3>
							 <p>You must duplicate the notice in <a href="#exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a> in each file of the
							  Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to
							  its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)
							  where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more
							  Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
							  <a href="#exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a>. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
							  for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to
							  Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
							  or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so
							  only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
							  must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
							  obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
							  and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
							  as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
							 <h3 id="section-3.6">3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</h3>
							 <p>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Sections
							  <a href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>, <a href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>,
							  <a href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>, <a href="#section-3.4">3.4</a> and
							  <a href="#section-3.5">3.5</a> have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a
							  notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms
							  of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations
							  of Section <a href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>. The notice must be conspicuously included in any
							  notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
							  recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of
							  Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
							  different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
							  License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
							  recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If
							  You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely
							  clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
							  Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
							  every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
							  a result of any such terms You offer.
							 <h3 id="section-3.7">3.7. Larger Works.</h3>
							 <p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the
							  terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
							  You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
							 <h2 id="section-4">4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</h2>
							 <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to
							  some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must:
							  (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe
							  the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the
							  <strong class="very-strong">legal</strong> file described in Section
							  <a href="#section-3.4">3.4</a> and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
							  Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
							  sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
							 <h2 id="section-5">5. Application of this License.</h2>
							 <p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in
							  <a href="#exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a> and to related Covered Code.
							 <h2 id="section-6">6. Versions of the License.</h2>
							 <h3 id="section-6.1">6.1. New Versions</h3>
							 <p>Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or new versions
							  of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
							 <h3 id="section-6.2">6.2. Effect of New Versions</h3>
							 <p>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may
							  always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such
							  Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape.
							  No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
							  created under this License.
							 <h3 id="section-6.3">6.3. Derivative Works</h3>
							 <p>If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to
							 apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)
							 rename Your license so that the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL",
							 "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that
							 your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of
							 the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public
							 License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the
							 notice described in <a href="#exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a> shall not of themselves be deemed to
							 be modifications of this License.)
							 <h2 id="section-7">7. <strong class="very-strong">Disclaimer of warranty</strong></h2>
							 <p><strong class="very-strong">Covered code is provided under this license on an "as is"
							  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without
							  limitation, warranties that the covered code is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a
							  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of
							  the covered code is with you. Should any covered code prove defective in any respect, you
							  (not the initial developer or any other contributor) assume the cost of any necessary
							  servicing, repair or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part
							  of this license. No use of any covered code is authorized hereunder except under this
							  disclaimer.</strong>
							 <h2 id="section-8">8. Termination</h2>
							 <p id="section-8.1">8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
							  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
							  within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which
							  are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by
							  their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
							 <p id="section-8.2">8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
							  claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor
							  (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to
							  as "Participant") alleging that:
							 <ol type="a">
							  <li id="section-8.2-a">such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
							   infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under
							   Sections <a href="#section-2.1">2.1</a> and/or <a href="#section-2.2">2.2</a> of this
							   License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if
							   within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay
							   Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of
							   Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with
							   respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of
							   notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in
							   writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by
							   Participant to You under Sections <a href="#section-2.1">2.1</a> and/or
							   <a href="#section-2.2">2.2</a> automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day
							   notice period specified above.
							  <li id="section-8.2-b">any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
							   Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights
							   granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(<a href="#section-2.1-b">b</a>)
							   and 2.2(<a href="#section-2.2-b">b</a>) are revoked effective as of the date You first
							   made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.
							 </ol>
							 <p id="section-8.3">8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
							  alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
							  any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
							  initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
							  granted by such Participant under Sections <a href="#section-2.1">2.1</a> or
							  <a href="#section-2.2">2.2</a> shall be taken into account in determining the amount or
							  value of any payment or license.
							 <p id="section-8.4">8.4. In the event of termination under Sections
							  <a href="#section-8.1">8.1</a> or <a href="#section-8.2">8.2</a> above, all end user
							  license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly
							  granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
							  termination.
							 <h2 id="section-9">9. <strong class="very-strong">Limitation of liability</strong></h2>
							 <p><strong class="very-strong">Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether
							  tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the initial developer,
							  any other contributor, or any distributor of covered code, or any supplier of any of
							  such parties, be liable to any person for any indirect, special, incidental, or
							  consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for loss
							  of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
							  commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the
							  possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability
							  for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent
							  applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion
							  or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation
							  may not apply to you.</strong>
							 <h2 id="section-10">10. <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> government end users</h2>
							 <p>The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48
							  <abbr>C.F.R.</abbr> 2.101 (<abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 1995), consisting of
							  "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
							  terms are used in 48 <abbr>C.F.R.</abbr> 12.212 (<abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr>
							  1995). Consistent with 48 <abbr>C.F.R.</abbr> 12.212 and 48 <abbr>C.F.R.</abbr>
							  227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all <abbr>U.S.</abbr> Government End Users
							  acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.
							 <h2 id="section-11">11. Miscellaneous</h2>
							 <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If
							  any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
							  reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
							  governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
							  provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to
							  disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or
							  registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to
							  this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
							  Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California,
							  with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court
							  costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United
							  Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
							  excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
							  shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
							 <h2 id="section-12">12. Responsibility for claims</h2>
							 <p>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for
							  claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights
							  under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
							  distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
							  shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
							 <h2 id="section-13">13. Multiple-licensed code</h2>
							 <p>Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
							  "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer permits
							  you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the <abbr>MPL</abbr>
